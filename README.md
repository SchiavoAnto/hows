# HOWS: Highly Optimized Web Server  
HOWS is a simple, basic web server.  
⚠️ This project is under heavy development! ⚠️

## Goal  
The goal of HOWS is to be an easily configurable web server: the config is saved as a JSON file.  
Currently supports:  
- custom 404 pages (per directory)
- directory content listing when an index page is not present
- configurable host address and port
- configurable root directory

## Running HOWS  
HOWS is developed in C# on .NET 8.0 without any dependencies.  
To run it, just open the solution file in Visual Studio 2022 and build it, or run `dotnet run` in the project directory.  

## Contributing  
If you find any problems or just want to contribute to the project, open an issue or a PR. I will check everything, but contributions are not the main objective of the project.
